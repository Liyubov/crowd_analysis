# General crowd analysis

This is repository to analyse citizen science data.
The analysis started with iNaturalist data analysis we did for iNaturalist https://github.com/correlaid-paris/citizen_science_inaturalist
Thanks to open data of other platforms such as iSpot here we also continue to analyse them https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.r0005

# Reseach questions (RQs)

RQ1: Can we identify macroscopic laws of citizen science projects? The main goal of the project to identify short-term and long-term dynamics in citizen science projects. (general RQ)

RQ2: How citizen science communities are growing in time, what drives their growth if not preferential attachment or exogenous factors?

RQ3: Specific for iNaturalist data. If we are looking at City Nature Challenge data - we have now data for San Francisco, LA, and London, which now have 4 or 3 years time series. How the power law like distributions of human activities are emerging? It's interesting that it is similar for SF and LA and the pattern that they have in year 4, London has in year 3.

RQ4: (a) Are there differences in data collection patterns in each year and between years? Are there also emerging pattern over time in a location? (b) Are there also emerging pattern over time in a location?
